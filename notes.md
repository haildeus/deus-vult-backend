## Open questions
- Characters
    - Using medieval characters? What classes do we have? Do we have stats?
    - How many messages do we parse with the bot? Keep limits in mind.
- How long should the poll be open?
    - Wait for 24h
- How long is the battle?
    - A minute
- Do we need any kind of onboarding?
    - Yes, but later

## Need to do
- Jobs (Look at pyrogram's scheduler)
- Better error handling
- Parsing messages
- DSPy optimization for summaries
- Add importing metadata to avoid circular import

## Ideas
- What if we do battles Space Rangers text style w/ some drawings?
    - What if we use webapp or inline query to let users decide?
- Should we send anything during the battle? Highlights?
- Riddles with disappearing messages. Press callback, bot opens, you get the disappearing picture.
