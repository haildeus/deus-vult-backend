## Open questions
- Characters
    - Using medieval characters? What classes do we have? Do we have stats? Items?
    - How many messages do we parse with the bot? Keep limits in mind.
    - Let's focus on creating the character, we'll do entity extraction for KG later.
- How long should the poll be open?
- How long is the battle?

## Need to do
- Jobs
- Better error handling
- Parsing messages
- DSPy optimization for summaries
- Add importing metadata to avoid circular import

## Ideas
- What if we do battles Space Rangers text style w/ some drawings?
- Should we send anything during the battle? Highlights?

## Current thing: Experimental disappearing messages engagement.
- Simple send message to chat and channel


### Nice to do things:
- Pylance
